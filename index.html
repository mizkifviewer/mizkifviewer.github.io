You must be wondering what this junkyard is.<br>
An ultimate agenda. Don't tell anyone ok?<br>
Bascially, it consists of 3 parts.<br>
(1) Power on my Starforge PC.<br>
(2) Open Twitch on my sixth monitor.<br>
(3) Watch Sodapoppin. I mean Mizkif. Report any suspicious activities to Emmett Shear.<br>
<br><br><br>You must be curious what I do for a living. <s>Ugh... I'm a full-stack developer at Theranos. Um... I profesionally play Overwatch while screaming at my teammates to heal me. Uhh... I vape with my frat bros while we watch horror movies and trade stocks on Robinhood.</s><br>
I have managed to get in touch with a member of the PayPal Mafia. They like what I am doing. Am I cool now or what? I can see the light at the end of the <a href="https://mizkifviewer.github.io/count.html" target="_top">tunnel</a>.<br>

<!-- I know who I'm thanking. Thank you. I would not have learned code if you didn't give me a push like Reiju for Sanji. I will try my best not to forget my encounters with you and others who greatly assisted me in this bizarre, lonesome adventure as long as I live. -->
