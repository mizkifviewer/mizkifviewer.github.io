You must be wondering what this junkyard is. An ultimate agenda. Don't tell anyone ok? Bascially, it consists of 3 parts.<br>
(1) Fire up a Starforge PC.<br>
(2) Open Twitch in Internet Explorer on my sixth monitor.<br>
(3) Watch Sodapoppin. I mean Mizkif. Report any suspicious activities to Emmett Shear.<br>
<br><br><br>You must be curious what I do for a living. <s>Ugh... I'm a full-stack developer at Theranos. Um... I profesionally play Overwatch while screaming at my teammates to heal me. Uhh... I snort cocaine with my frat bros while we watch horror movies and trade stocks on Robinhood.</s>
I can see the light at the end of the <a href="https://mizkifviewer.github.io/count.html" target="_top">tunnel</a>. <s>Lots of followers on Myspace. An Ig Noble Prize. 0 people in attendance at my funeral.</s>

<!-- I know who I'm thanking. Thank you. I would not have learned code if you didn't give me a push like Reiju for Sanji. I will try my best not to forget my encounters with you and others who greatly assisted me in this bizarre, lonesome adventure as long as I live. -->
