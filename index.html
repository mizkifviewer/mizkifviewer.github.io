You must be wondering, "What is this crap?"<br>
An ultimate agenda. Don't tell anyone ok?<br>
Bascially, it consists of 3 parts.<br>
(1) Power on my Starforge PC.<br>
(2) Open Twitch on my sixth monitor.<br>
(3) Watch DisguisedToast. I mean Mizkif. Report any suspicious activities to my supervisor, Gabe Whaley.<br><br><br><br>
You must be curious what I do for a living. Ugh... I'm a full-stack developer at Theranos. Um... I profesionally play Overwatch while screaming at my teammates to heal me. Uhh... I vape with my frat brothers from other mothers while we watch horror movies and trade stocks on Robinhood.<br>

<!-- Thank you ******. I would not have learned code if you didn't give me a push like Reiju for Sanji. I will try my best not to forget my encounters with you and others who greatly assisted me in this bizarre solo adventure as long as I live. -->
